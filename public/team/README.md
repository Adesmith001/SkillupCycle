## Placeholder Temporary Solution:

Until you have professional photos, the site will display:
- Initial letters in colored circles
- Gradient backgrounds matching the brand colors
- This creates a cohesive look while photos are being prepared

## Adding Photos:

1. Name files exactly as listed above
2. Optimize images using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh
3. Place files in this directory (`public/team/`)
4. Photos will automatically appear on the site (no code changes needed)
